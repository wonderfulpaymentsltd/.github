# Wonderful Payments

[Wonderful](https://wonderful.co.uk/)'s direct, A2A (account-to-account) payments service helps consumers, businesses, charities and their supporters do more good. Founded in 2016 with its [100% fee-free fundraising platform](https://wonderful.org/), Wonderful continues to disrupt the status quo with its expansion to a full commercial offering for online retailers and other brands.

We're creating a payment network with CSR baked-in (it's how we got started), so whether you're running the marathon or buying the trainers, we make giving back easier for everyone. Our obsession with delightful user experiences and our vision to do the right thing makes us a wonderful force for change.
